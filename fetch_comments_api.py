"""Fetch new comments from the regulations.gov API and append them to source.csv.

A workaround for the bulk-download form (regulations.gov/bulkdownload), whose
instructions ask for a date range that has no input field, so the request cannot
be submitted. This pulls the same data through the documented v4 API instead and
writes rows in the identical CSV schema, so everything downstream is unchanged.

It works incrementally: existing Document IDs are read from source.csv and only
comments not already present are fetched. A full docket costs one API call per
comment, which is impractical at the standard 1,000/hour key limit; a daily
delta of ~1,000 is comfortable.

Requires REGULATIONS_API_KEY (free: https://open.gsa.gov/api/regulationsgov/).
DEMO_KEY works but rate-limits almost immediately.

Usage:

    The API caps a result set at 5,000 (20 pages x 250), so once a window fills

    a set larger than the cap.

    `since` (YYYY-MM-DD) starts the walk from that date instead of the beginning
    of the docket. This matters more than it looks: listing costs one call per
    250 comments, so walking a 61,000-comment docket burns ~245 of the ~500 calls
    the key allows per hour — half the budget spent before a single new comment
    is fetched. Starting from the newest row already held costs a handful.

    `since` seeds the SAME lastModifiedDate cursor the paging already uses,
    rather than adding a second postedDate filter: the API returns 400 when both
    date filters are sent at once, which only shows up once a result set exceeds
    the 5,000 cap and the cursor kicks in. Filtering on lastModifiedDate is a
