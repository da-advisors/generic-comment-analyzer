Second-pass verification of stance and entity type classifications.

Sends flagged comments to a stronger model for re-evaluation.
Configuration is driven by the second_pass section in analyzer_config.yaml.

Can be run standalone or called from pipeline.py.

Usage:
    python3 verify_stances.py full_run.parquet                    # verify and update in place
    python3 verify_stances.py full_run.parquet --output verified.parquet  # write to new file

- has_cosigners is true ONLY if the letter's OWN closing/signature section names 2+ DISTINCT PEOPLE or 2+ DISTINCT ORGANIZATIONS as signers or endorsers of THIS COMMENT — not people or organizations merely discussed, cited, or assessed somewhere in the body text.
- A single person's own contact block (their name, followed by their title, followed by their organization/affiliation) is ONE signer, even though it spans several lines — do NOT count title or organization lines as separate signers.
- Do NOT count: a sentence in the body citing what other organizations said/assessed/authored (e.g. "X, Y, and Z jointly assessed that..." or "a brief authored by X, Y, and Z") — that is a citation, not this letter's signature block. Do NOT count the author byline, references, or contributor notes of an attached research paper/article — a comment that attaches a multi-author paper for support is still a single submitter's comment.
- Formal boilerplate like "the undersigned submits this comment" used by a SINGLE person does NOT count — that person writing in formal/plural style alone is not a coalition letter.
- When in doubt, prefer has_cosigners=false. This should only be true when you can point to actual distinct names, each clearly signing on their own behalf, in the letter's own signature section.
- If has_cosigners is true, extract two VERBATIM quotes that bound the ENTIRE section listing the letter's own distinct signers: block_start (the first signer's name) and block_end (the LAST signer's own name or their final title/org line — re-check the text after your first guess for block_end to make sure no further distinct signer appears after it; if one does, extend block_end to cover them too). Both must be exact substrings of the provided text. Do not let the span extend into body prose, an attached paper, or citations.
- If has_cosigners is false, leave block_start and block_end empty."""
